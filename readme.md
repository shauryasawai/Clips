# üéµ Clips Backend API - Complete Guide

A simple web service for managing and streaming short audio clips.

## üåü What This Project Does

Imagine you have a music library app where people can:
- Browse a list of short audio clips (like previews of songs)
- Play these clips by clicking on them
- See how many times each clip has been played
- Add new clips to the library

This project creates the "behind-the-scenes" part (called a backend) that makes all of this possible. It's like having a smart filing cabinet that can:
- Store information about audio clips
- Keep track of how popular each clip is
- Serve audio files when someone wants to listen
- Monitor how well everything is working

## üéØ Project Overview for Non-Technical People

### What You'll See When It's Running
1. **A Web API** - A service that responds to requests (like "show me all clips" or "play clip #3")
2. **A Database** - Where all the clip information is stored (titles, descriptions, play counts)
3. **A Monitoring Dashboard** - Pretty graphs showing how busy your service is
4. **Audio Playback** - You can actually listen to the clips through your web browser

### Real-World Example
Think of it like a digital jukebox:
- The **database** is like the catalog of all available songs
- The **API** is like the buttons you press to select songs
- The **monitoring** is like the screen showing which songs are most popular
- The **audio streaming** is the actual music coming out of the speakers

   docker-compose exec api python seed_data.py
   ```

**That's it!** Your app is now running.

### Option 2: Manual Setup (For Developers)

**What You Need:**
- Python 3.11 or higher
- PostgreSQL database
- More technical knowledge

**Steps:**
1. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Set up PostgreSQL database

4. Run database setup: `python seed_data.py`
5. Start the application: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`

## üåê How to Use Your Running Application

### 1. View the API Documentation
- Open your web browser
- Go to: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- You'll see a beautiful interface showing all available features

### 2. Test the Basic Features
- **See all clips:** Visit `http://localhost:8000/clips`
- **Play a clip:** Visit `http://localhost:8000/clips/1/stream`
- **Check play stats:** Visit `http://localhost:8000/clips/1/stats`

### 3. View the Monitoring Dashboard
- Open: `http://localhost:3000`
- Login with username: `admin`, password: `admin`
- See real-time graphs of your app's performance

### 4. Play Audio Clips
Create an HTML file called `player.html` (provided in the project) and open it in your browser for a user-friendly audio player interface.

## üéµ What Sample Data You'll Get

When you run the setup, you'll automatically get 6 sample audio clips:

1. **Ocean Waves** (Ambient, 30 seconds) - Relaxing ocean sounds
2. **Urban Beat** (Electronic, 45 seconds) - Modern city vibes
3. **Acoustic Guitar** (Acoustic, 60 seconds) - Gentle guitar melody

5. **Synthwave Dream** (Electronic, 55 seconds) - Retro futuristic music
6. **Jazz Piano** (Jazz, 35 seconds) - Smooth piano improvisation

Each clip starts with 0 plays, and the count increases every time someone streams it.

## üìä Understanding the Monitoring Dashboard

### What You'll See in Grafana (the monitoring tool):

**"Total API Requests"** - How many people have used your app
- Like counting visitors to your store

**"Response Time"** - How fast your app responds
- Like measuring how quickly a cashier serves customers

**"Stream Count by Clip"** - Which clips are most popular
- Like seeing which books are checked out most from a library

**"Request Rate Over Time"** - How busy your app is throughout the day
- Like tracking customer traffic patterns in a store

**"Error Rate"** - How often things go wrong
- Like tracking customer complaints

### Manual Testing (Using Your Browser)
1. **Check if it's working:** `http://localhost:8000/health`
2. **See all clips:** `http://localhost:8000/clips`
3. **Play a clip:** `http://localhost:8000/clips/1/stream`
4. **Check how many times it was played:** `http://localhost:8000/clips/1/stats`

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Nothing is working!"
- **Check if Docker is running** - Look for the Docker whale icon in your system tray
- **Try restarting everything:**
  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  docker-compose up --build -d
  ```

### "I can't access the websites"
- **Wait a bit longer** - Sometimes it takes 2-3 minutes for everything to start
- **Check if something else is using the ports** - Close other development tools
- **Try different ports** - Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file to use different port numbers

### "No audio clips found"
- **Run the data loading command:**
  ```bash
  docker-compose exec api python seed_data.py
  ```

### "The audio won't play"
- **Check your internet connection** - The sample audio files are hosted online
- **Try a different browser** - Some browsers block audio playback
- **Check browser permissions** - Allow audio playback when prompted
